about: >-
  Based in Cardiff, the group leader Qari Ghulam Nabi Hafiz has been providing
  Hajj and Umrah services for over 25 years. This has allowed us to gain
  valuable contacts within Makkah and Medina.


  Before you set off, we provide numerous group meetings to educate you on what
  you can expect when you go there.


  When you are there we will ensure that food, travel and accommodation is all
  sorted, so that you can concentrate on your prayers.
